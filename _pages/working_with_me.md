Hi!

Thanks for being curious about how to work with me! Before jumping into means how to do that, let me describe how I work to ensure we are a good fit.


## What can you expect when working with me?
- I thrive in open, honest, flat organizational cultures, where people have all three legs of [Self-determination Theory](https://path2phd.substack.com/p/on-self-determination-theory)
- I prefer smaller teams (up to around 8 people) and can benefit the most from one-on-one conversations
- I am loyal to the team I am part of; it's not an option to let anyone fail
- I do my best technical work alone, or in front of a whiteboard with a team member
- I do my best creative setting in a "casual" environment (think coffee chat)
- I like things reasonably organized, but aim to avoid unnecessary overhead
- Meetings I participate in should be on time, have an agenda, and lead by someone in the team
- I am neither the best theoretician nor the best programmer, I deal in ideas - though I have a fairly theoretical approach with a no-nonsense mentality
- I am a good high-level, interdisciplinary thinker, my main contribution is connecting the dots between (seemingly) separate fields
- My goal is to help everyone succeed. The pie needs to grow
- I seek feedback (negative included); I am here to learn from my mistakes
- I prefer transparent communication - if me or you cannot keep a promise, it's OK, but both of us needs to be clear about it
- I will strive to learn about your goals and motivation and help you fulfill them
- My projects are _not_ done in the two weeks before the deadline. I plan ahead and keep a consistent effort
- I protect my sleep (at least 7 hours) at all cost. No all nighters - lack of sleep robs my clear thinking and creativity

## How can you work with me?
I always have too many ideas and enjoy working with interesting people.
